# Sequelized Burger Application 

## Getting Started 

Created a Sequelized `Burger` app. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
My app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
